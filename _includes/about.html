                    <h4>Professional Background</h4>
                    <p>With over 10 years of experience in software engineering, I worked with many different programming languages and frameworks. My core expertise is Swift but I am always excited to expand my skill set.</p>

                    <h4>International Experience</h4>
                    <p>Since 2017, I have been living and working in the Netherlands, which has broadened my perspective and enhanced my ability to work in diverse, multicultural environments. Prior to this, I lived and worked in São Paulo, Brazil.</p>

                    <h4>Progressive Mindset</h4>
                    <p>I approach both my work and worldview with a progressive mindset. I believe in creating technology that positively impacts society, promotes inclusivity, and contributes to a more equitable world.</p>

                    <h4>Seeking a Positive Work Environment</h4>
                    <p>I am specifically seeking opportunities with smaller, more agile organizations. I believe these environments often foster more creativity, allow for greater individual impact, and maintain a healthier work-life balance.</p>

                <!-- Witty content (6pm-6am) -->
                <div class="col-lg-4 col-lg-offset-2 witty-about" style="display: none;">
                    <h4>Professional Background</h4>
                    <p>After a decade of convincing computers to do things they don't want to do, I've mastered the art of arguing with Swift compilers and occasionally winning. I've dabbled in enough programming languages to know that they're all terrible in their own special ways, and I have developed a particularly toxic codependent relationship with Swift, that somehow produces functional software.</p>

                    <h4>International Experience</h4>
                    <p>In 2017, I traded São Paulo's charming combination of traffic jams and existential dread for the Netherlands' delightfully passive-aggressive politeness and an alarming number of bicycles. This cultural whiplash has taught me that no matter where you go, people are fundamentally the same: they want their apps to work, and they want them yesterday. My "global perspective" mostly consists of knowing how to complain about code in Portuguese, English, and broken Dutch.</p>

                <div class="col-lg-4 witty-about" style="display: none;">
                    <h4>Progressive Mindset</h4>
                    <p>I'm one of those insufferable developers who actually thinks technology should help people instead of just extracting their data for profit. I know, revolutionary stuff. I believe in building inclusive software, probably because I've spent enough time being excluded from things myself to know it sucks. My approach to problem-solving involves asking uncomfortable questions like "Wait, are we actually solving a real problem or just creating a more efficient way to waste people's time?"</p>

                    <h4>Seeking a Positive Work Environment</h4>
                    <p>I've done my time in the corporate trenches, sitting through meetings about meetings and watching perfectly good ideas die in committees. Now I'm looking for a smaller company where "synergy" isn't a dirty word and where my individual contributions won't disappear into the bureaucratic void like tears in rain. Basically, I want to work somewhere that treats developers like humans instead of glorified code monkeys, where "work-life balance" isn't just something they put on the careers page to lure in suikers, and where innovation means more than just adding AI to everything because it's trendy.</p>
