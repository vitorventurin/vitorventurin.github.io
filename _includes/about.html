                    <h4>Professional Background</h4>
                    <p>With over 10 years of experience in software engineering, I worked with many different programming languages and frameworks. My core expertise is Swift but I am always excited to expand my skill set.</p>

                    <h4>International Experience</h4>
                    <p>Since 2017, I have been living and working in the Netherlands, which has broadened my perspective and enhanced my ability to work in diverse, multicultural environments. Prior to this, I lived and worked in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil.</p>

                    <h4>Progressive Mindset</h4>
                    <p>I approach both my work and worldview with a progressive mindset. I believe in creating technology that positively impacts society, promotes inclusivity, and contributes to a more equitable world.</p>

                    <h4>Seeking a Positive Work Environment</h4>
                    <p>I am specifically seeking opportunities with smaller, more agile organizations. I believe these environments often foster more creativity, allow for greater individual impact, and maintain a healthier work-life balance.</p>
