description: "Sonora is an app targeted to foley artists, where they can create layers of sounds, by typing words. For example, you can mix 'tropical rain' + 'helicopter flying' + 'battlefield', and move the sound objects around your phone screen, manipulating their volume and panning. Skills: Godot framework, gdscript, free audio APIs."
