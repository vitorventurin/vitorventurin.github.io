description: "Sometimes I want to upload songs to moises.ai for studying purposes, therefore I created Musicalibre. It is a music scrapper that downloads the files from youtube and add tags to the mp3 file, such as artist name, coverart, titles, etc. DISCLAIMER: this app is not intended to piracy. Once you use the files, please delete them from your disk, and support the artists buying their albums."
